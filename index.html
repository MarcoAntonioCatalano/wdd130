        <p> I'm Marco Catalano, from Rosario, Argentina.
            I love architecture and design in general. I have a bachelors in Interior Design.
            In my free time I enjoy outdoor sports and traveling the most.
            Since I mention traveling, I'm actually visiting Argentina right now. A friend of mine that I've known since
            I was 5 years old got married on this past Saturday.
            What a wonderful fun moment was to celebrate a dear friend.
            Weddings have many different cultural protocols in different countries. Here in Argentina, right after the
            matrimonial ceremony it comes the dinning section, which is fairly equal to other weddings. But later on you
            have the dancing.
            The dancing could last until very early hours of the next day. For example, we stayed until 3:30 am.
            Traveling teaches me how diverse societies are, how important it is to respect and appreciate cultural views
            on social interactions.
            On another note, and also something that I enjoy is being outdoor. Exercise can be done many ways. While
            traveling
            I love to go on walks as part of my exercise. Because I can connected with sight seeing. There are many
            beautiful
            european building that date the post-world wars european migrations to the southern continent.
            Walking it's not just a great exercise, but it becomes fun, as I walk through renown architectural
            buildings.
            So, a win win situation.
            Last but no least, I'd like to mention another cultural exchange that enriches cultures, that's the culinary
            arts.
            Gastronomy in this case "Argentina," portrays a wide range of dishes from many european countries. There are
            so many
            communities that it would dificult to name them all, but the most well-know are, Spanish dishes from
            different regions of Spanish,
            Italy and its regions. Also, Germans, Polish, Russian, Middle eastern, etc.
